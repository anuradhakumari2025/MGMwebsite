        about={[
          "Right from the date of inception of Mahatma Gandhi Missionâ€™s College of Engineering and Technology (MGMCET), Department of Biomedical Engineering started a four years full-time undergraduate degree program (BE) in Biomedical Engineering with an intake of 15 students in the year 1986. Novelty and attractiveness of the program saw the intake gradually growing to 60 by the year 1997. Encouraged by the response, the institution started two years full-time postgraduate degree program (ME) in Biomedical Engineering with intake of 18 students in 2001. It is the only recognized college in the University of Mumbai to impart postgraduate degree program (ME) in Biomedical Engineering.",
          " The department is facilitated with in-campus Medical College and Hospital. Our students visit various departments in the hospital like Radiology, Orthopaedics, Cardiology, Pathology, Physiotherapy, Endoscopy and Operation Theatres etc. for better understanding of the use of biomedical and imaging equipment.",
          " Our department was awarded accreditation by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in 2006 for 3 years. In past thirty-five years, more than 1300 students have graduated in Bio-Medical Engineering and have often obtained rank in the University. Through campus interviews, many students have got placement in reputed companies like PHILIPS, IGATE, Tata Elexi, GE-Healthcare, Infosys, and Roche Diagno  with a package ranging from 3.0 to 6.0 Lakhs.",
